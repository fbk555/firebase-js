/*
In NativeScript, the app.css file is where you place CSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the CSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
For example, the following CSS rule changes the font size of all UI
components that have the btn class name.
*/
.btn {
    font-size: 18;
}

action-bar {
  background-color: #053140;
  color: white;
}
label {
  margin: 20;
}
.drawer-content {
  background-color: #053140;
  color: white;
  padding-top: 20;
}
.drawer-content label {
  font-size: 20;
  margin: 10 0 15 25;
}
.selected {
  color: #e4ba4e;
}

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own CSS rules. For a full list of class names in the theme
refer to http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.
